# decoherence-selected-TPSs
Code to select quasi-classical Tensor Product Structures using a Decoherence motivated criterion.

```HSF_v7.ipynb``` is the main jupyter notebook. ```find_qcTPS_PennyLane.ipynb``` is an older version of the code in ```HSF_v7.ipynb``` but written using the PennyLane package as opposed to the QuTip package. All other files are modules that are imported and used in the main jupyter notebook.
